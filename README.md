This is a project that predicts the stock value of a company by analyzing its past trends. I have used Tensorflow as the backend engine for Keras. This program analyses the stock market data of a company for the past 60 days from now and predicts the next stock value. Try it out with different companies by changing the stock symbol(ticker) in the "company" variable!

<h2>DisclaimerðŸ›‘</h2>
This is just an experimental project and I don't guarantee that the predicted values of this program to be correct all the time. I suggest to not use this as a guide for predicting stock market but to use this to understand how a basic neural network(Sequential) works.
